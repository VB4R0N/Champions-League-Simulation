## ðŸ“Œ Key Features
- **Monte Carlo simulations** of match outcomes using betting odds and historical score distributions
- **Interactive Shiny dashboard** for visualizing team-specific probabilities
- **Reproducible workflows** with full code and data transparency (included csv-files)

---

## ðŸ§® Methodology

### 1. Probability Estimation
- **Match Outcome Probabilities**: Derived from betting odds ([oddschecker.com](https://www.oddschecker.com/)) using implied probability calculations
- **Score Distributions**: Conditional probabilities based on 5+ years of historical match data ([footystats.org](https://footystats.org/))

### 2. Simulation Engine
```r
for (sim in 1:50000) {
  # 1. Reset league table
  # 2. Simulate match outcomes using:
  #    - Odds-derived win/draw probabilities
  #    - Historical score distributions
  # 3. Update league standings
  # 4. Aggregate results
}
