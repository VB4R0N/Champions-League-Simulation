Overview
This repository contains a Monte Carlo simulation of the last Champions League Matchday. I simulated the matchday 50,000 times to predict outcomes.

Methodology

    Win/Draw/Loss Probabilities: Calculated using betting odds.
    Conditional Probabilities: Derived from historical match data.
    Dashboard: Visual tool for specific event probabilities.


Results
Simulations predict probabilities for teams advancing to different stages. See images for detailed results.

Data & Code
